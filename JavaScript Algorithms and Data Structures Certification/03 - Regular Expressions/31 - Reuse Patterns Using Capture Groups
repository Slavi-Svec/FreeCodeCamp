Reuse Patterns Using Capture Groups

Use capture groups in reRegex to match numbers that are repeated only three times in a string,
each separated by a space.

let repeatNum = "42 42 42";
let reRegex = /change/; // Change this line
let result = reRegex.test(repeatNum);

// Solution 

let repeatNum = "42 42 42"
let reRegex = /^(\d+)\s\1\s\1$/
let result = reRegex.test(repeatNum)
