Match Numbers and Letters of the Alphabet

Using the hyphen (-) to match a range of characters is not limited to letters. It also works to match a range of numbers.

For example, /[0-5]/ matches any number between 0 and 5, including the 0 and 5.

Also, it is possible to combine a range of letters and numbers in a single character set.

let quoteSample = "Blueberry 3.141592653s are delicious.";
let myRegex = /change/; // Change this line
let result = myRegex; // Change this line

// Solution 

let quoteSample = "Blueberry 3.141592653s are delicious.";
let myRegex =/[h-s2-6]/gi
let result = quoteSample.match(myRegex)
