Sum All Primes

A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 with exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 
2 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 2. In contrast, 4 is not prime since it is divisible
by 1, 2 and 4.

Rewrite sumPrimes so it returns the sum of all prime numbers that are less than or equal to num.

function sumPrimes(num) {
  return num;
}

sumPrimes(10);

// Solution


  function sumPrimes(num) {
    let stored  = [], i, j
    let  primes = [];
    for (i = 2; i <= num; ++i) {
        if (!stored [i])  {
            primes.push(i);
            for (j = i << 1; j <= num; j += i) {
                stored[j] = true;
            }
        }
    }
    return primes.reduce((a,b) => a + b, 0)
}

console.log(sumPrimes(10))
