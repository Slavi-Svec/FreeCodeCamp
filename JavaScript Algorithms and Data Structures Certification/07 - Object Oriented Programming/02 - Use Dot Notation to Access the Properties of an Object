Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object

Dot notation is used on the object name, duck, followed by the name of the property, name, to access the value of "Aflac".

Print both properties of the dog object to your console.

let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};
// Only change code below this line

// Solution 

let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};

console.log(dog.name)
console.log(dog.numLegs)
