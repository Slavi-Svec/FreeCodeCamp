 Sort an Array Alphabetically using the sort Method
 
 avaScript's default sorting method is by string Unicode point value, which may return unexpected results.
 Therefore, it is encouraged to provide a callback function to specify how to sort the array items. When such 
 a callback function, normally called compareFunction, is supplied, the array elements are sorted according to the
 return value of the compareFunction: If compareFunction(a,b) returns a value less than 0 for two elements a and b,
 then a will come before b. If compareFunction(a,b) returns a value greater than 0 for two elements a and b, then b
 will come before a. If compareFunction(a,b) returns a value equal to 0 for two elements a and b, then a and b will
 remain unchanged.

Use the sort method in the alphabeticalOrder function to sort the elements of arr in alphabetical order.

function alphabeticalOrder(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
}
alphabeticalOrder(["a", "d", "c", "a", "z", "g"]);


// Solution
