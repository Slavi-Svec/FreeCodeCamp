Comment Your JavaScript Code

There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:

Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line:

// This is an in-line comment.
You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /* and ending with */:

/* This is a
multi-line comment */
Best Practice
As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others and for your future self.

Try creating one of each type of comment.

//  Solution 



//  this is an in-line comment.


/* this is  
also a comment. */
