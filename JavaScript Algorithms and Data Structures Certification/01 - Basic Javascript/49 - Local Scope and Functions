Local Scope and Functions

Declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope. Run the tests and then follow the instructions
commented out in the editor.

Hint
Refreshing the page may help if you get stuck.


function myLocalScope() {
  'use strict'; // you shouldn't need to edit this line

  console.log(myVar);
}
myLocalScope();

// Run and check the console
// myVar is not defined outside of myLocalScope
console.log(myVar);

// Now remove the console log line to pass the test


// Solution 

function myLocalScope() {
 
var myVar = "HELLO"; 
console.log(myVar);
}
myLocalScope();
