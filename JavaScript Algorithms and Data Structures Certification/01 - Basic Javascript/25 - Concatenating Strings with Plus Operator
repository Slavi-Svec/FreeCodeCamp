Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator

Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Build myStr from the strings "This is the start. " and "This is the end." using the + operator.

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr;

// Solution 

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end."
