Iterate Odd Numbers With a For Loop

ourArray will now contain [0,2,4,6,8]. Let's change our initialization so we can count by odd numbers.

Push the odd numbers from 1 through 9 to myArray using a for loop.

// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line

// solution 

for (let i = 1; i < 10; i += 2) {
myArray.push(i)
}
