Caesars Cipher

One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher.
In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' â†” 'N', 'B' â†” 'O' and so on.

Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.


function rot13(str) {

  return str;
}

rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC");


// Solution 

const rot13 = (str) => { 
  let decoded = ""
  const charCheck = (char) => char < 65 ? char : char % 26 + 65
  for(let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    var x = str.charCodeAt(i);
    decoded += String.fromCharCode(charCheck(x))
  }
  return decoded
}
