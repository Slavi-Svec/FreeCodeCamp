Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from Objects

Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still 
assign the variables today and tomorrow the values of today and
tomorrow from the HIGH_TEMPERATURES object.

const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};

// change code below this line

const today = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.today;
const tomorrow = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.tomorrow;

// change code above this line

console.log(yesterday) // should be not defined
console.log(today); // should be 77
console.log(tomorrow); // should be 80

// Solution 

const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};

const { today, tomorrow } = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;
