Mutate an Array Declared with const

As you can see, you can mutate the object [5, 6, 7] itself and the variable s will still point to the altered array [5, 6, 45]. Like all arrays, the array elements in s are mutable, but because const was used, you cannot use the variable identifier s to point to a different array using the assignment operator.

An array is declared as const s = [5, 7, 2]. Change the array to [2, 5, 7] using various element assignment.



const s = [5, 7, 2];
function editInPlace() {
  'use strict';
  // change code below this line

  // s = [2, 5, 7]; <- this is invalid

  // change code above this line
}
editInPlace();


// Solution 

const s = [5, 7, 2];
function editInPlace() {
  'use strict';
  

s[0] = 2;
s[1] = 5;
s[2] = 7;

}
editInPlace();
