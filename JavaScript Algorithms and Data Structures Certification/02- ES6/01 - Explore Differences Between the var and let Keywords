Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords

This error can be seen in the console of your browser. So unlike var, when using let,
a variable with the same name can only be declared once. Note the "use strict". This enables Strict Mode, 
which catches common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions. For instance:

var catName;
var quote;
function catTalk() {
  "use strict";

  catName = "Oliver";
  quote = catName + " says Meow!";

}
catTalk();

// Solution 

let catName;
let quote;
function catTalk() {
  "use strict";

  catName = "Oliver";
  quote = catName + " says Meow!";

}
catTalk();
