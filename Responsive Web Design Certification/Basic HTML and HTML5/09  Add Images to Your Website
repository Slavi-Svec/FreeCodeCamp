 Add Images to Your Website
 
 Let's try to add an image to our website:

Insert an img tag, after the main element.

Now set the src attribute so that it points to this url:

https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat

Finally don't forget to give your image an alt text.



<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<main>
<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles 
  chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
  <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch 
  sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
</main>


Solution:

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
